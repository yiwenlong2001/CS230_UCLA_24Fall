# CS230_UCLA_24Fall
Project for UCLA CS230 

### Usage:

In the converter file, put regex in the list object called regex. Then run the script to convert to CFG.
We also wrote for it to take txt files, but we commented it out to keep it simple for now.

### Evaluation:

1. cd to the evaluation folder, run the evaluation.sh script. 
Log will be generated, and the scoreboard.txt will be updated with new results

2. run the unittest in the test_cfg_generation.py
